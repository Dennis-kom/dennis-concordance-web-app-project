POEM 1 – Velvet Promises
We met where neon chandeliers glowed,
Love dressed sharp in tailored light.
Silk words whispered over wine,
Hands brushing, hearts in flight.
Gold watches ticked like borrowed time,
Desire warm, restrained, implied,
But beneath the velvet promises,
I loved you more than you replied.

POEM 2 – Expensive Nights
Your love smelled like leather and rain,
Like credit cards and midnight drives.
We didn’t name the heat between us,
Just let it live between our lives.
Champagne laughter, hotel sheets,
A passion quiet, slow, intense,
We paid in looks and sleepless hours,
And called it love, not consequence.

POEM 3 – Gifts Wrapped in Silence
Diamonds spoke when words fell short,
Bracelets tried to say “I stay”.
Your kisses came with hidden costs,
Affection dressed in cellophane.
I wore your gifts, not your truth,
Felt wanted, but never chosen,
Love shouldn’t rattle when it moves,
Or arrive already broken.

POEM 4 – Love on Layaway
We planned forever in installments,
Desire strong, commitment thin.
Our bodies knew the choreography,
Our hearts forgot to check in.
You touched me like a habit,
Safe, familiar, incomplete,
Sex without surrender feels
Like dancing with retreating feet.

POEM 5 – After the Receipt
Now all that’s left are empty rooms,
And memories with price tags torn.
No refunds for the nights we spent,
No warranty on love outworn.
I learned the cost of almost-love,
Of passion dressed in borrowed gold,
Some things are priceless when they’re real,
And worthless when they’re sold.
