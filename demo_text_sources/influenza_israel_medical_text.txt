Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern in Israel, particularly during the winter months, when viral transmission rates increase due to close indoor contact and reduced ventilation. Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused primarily by influenza A and B viruses, which are characterized by high mutation rates and antigenic drift. In Israel, surveillance data collected by the Ministry of Health and sentinel clinics indicate recurrent outbreaks that place substantial pressure on primary care services, emergency departments, and internal medicine wards. Common clinical manifestations include fever, myalgia, headache, cough, sore throat, and general malaise, while severe cases may progress to viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or secondary bacterial infections.

High-risk populations in Israel include elderly individuals, infants, pregnant women, and patients with chronic comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression. In these groups, influenza infection is associated with increased morbidity, hospitalization rates, and mortality. Pediatric wards often experience seasonal overcrowding due to complications such as bronchiolitis, otitis media, and febrile seizures. Diagnostic confirmation is typically achieved through rapid antigen detection tests or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which allows differentiation between influenza subtypes and guides clinical decision-making.

Preventive strategies in Israel emphasize annual influenza vaccination, which is offered free of charge to high-risk populations through the national healthcare system. The vaccine aims to induce adaptive immunity by stimulating the production of strain-specific antibodies, thereby reducing disease severity and transmission. Antiviral agents such as oseltamivir may be prescribed in severe or high-risk cases to inhibit viral replication when administered early in the disease course. Public health campaigns also promote non-pharmacological interventions, including hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and isolation of symptomatic individuals, to limit community spread and protect vulnerable populations.
